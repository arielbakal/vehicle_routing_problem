# Vehicle Routing Problem

Hi! I'll be trying to solve this interesting optimization problem. I'll start developing basic algorithms with basics questions and then continuosly optimizing and upgrading it. This is a step by step path!
Later i'll be trying implementing metaheuristics. 

I invite you to follow this process, which i'll detail on a jupyter notebook.

Any pull request are welcome!
